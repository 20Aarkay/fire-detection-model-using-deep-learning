# Fire Detection Model using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning model for detecting fire and smoke in images. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and deployed using Streamlit for creating an interactive web application.

## Overview

The fire detection model is trained on a dataset containing images of fire, smoke, and non-fire scenes. The model architecture consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to classify images into three categories: fire, smoke, and non-fire.

The trained model achieves high accuracy in classifying images, making it suitable for real-world applications such as fire detection in surveillance systems, firefighting drones, and environmental monitoring.

## Features

- Image classification: The model can classify images into three categories: fire, smoke, and non-fire.
- Streamlit app: The model is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to upload images and view the classification results in real-time.
